Hi, I was born and raised in the RGV. I'm currently majoring in computer science. 
I've always been fascinated by technology and the way it can change the world. When I'm not staring at my computer trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong in my code, you can often find me out on the soccer field or hitting the trails on my mountain bike. 
Soccer has been a passion of mine since I was young, and I enjoy both playing and watching the game. 
Mountain biking is a newer hobby for me, but I love the rush of adrenaline and the feeling of being out in nature.
